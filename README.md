**Analysis outline:**
• Clearly state the research questions you want to answer
• Carry out an EDA of your series. Use different plots to analyse trend and seasonality patterns. Include a convenient Decomposition of series.

**Model fitting**
• Fit the series with an appropriate ARMA, ARIMA or SARIMA model.
• Mention and check the assumptions of the model used.
• Use the ACF, PACF and plots as well as the AIC criterion for the selection of your model.

**Forecasting**
• Forecast your series for future values.
• Forecast your series also for existing values, for example, if your data is monthly and the last values correspond to the year 2020, forecast the series for each month of 2020 (or last two years). 
Evaluate the forecast accuracy.
